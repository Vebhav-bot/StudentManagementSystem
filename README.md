# StudentManagementSystem
this help in managing student details
Project Description:
This project is a console-based Java application that allows users to manage student records efficiently. It supports basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using file-based storage and follows a layered architecture to maintain code clarity and modularity.

Feature Explanation:
Creating the new core Java project with JDK & IDE setup 
You initialized a Java project using an IDE and set up the required JDK, forming the foundation of the application.

Define the project structure 
You planned and organized the structure logically (e.g., separating classes into packages like model, service, and utility).

Maintain the proper file structure for the project 
Basic file structure was followed, but there's room to improve organization and consistency.

Auto-create file to perform CRUD 
When the program runs, it checks for the required data file and creates it if missing, enabling persistent storage.

Implement IO file connectivity from Java
File handling (reading/writing student data) is correctly implemented using Javaâ€™s IO libraries.

Create a proper layered architecture to perform CRUD operations 
Code is split into layers:

Model: Holds student data

Service: Business logic for CRUD

Utility: File operations

Main class: User interaction

Input Validation 
Input fields like student ID, name, and marks are validated to prevent invalid entries.

Accuracy of Output 
The program displays and updates student records correctly, though there may be minor improvements possible.

Error Messages and Feedback 
The program provides helpful error messages and user feedback during incorrect inputs or failures.
